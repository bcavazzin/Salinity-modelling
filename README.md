Background:
I have taken lake sediment samples from ~90 lakes in southern Saskatchewan, Canada. 
From the sediment samples I have extracted organic material (lipids from bacteria called GDGTs). Each lipid has a unique structure which is an adaptation 
to warmer/cooler temperature and changes in the pH of the soil where these bacteria live. By using statistical modelling, we can quantify these changes 
and apply them to reconstruct the climate in the past (2000 years) in this region. While sampling the lakes we have also collected measurements such as 
water temperature, pH etc. We also have monthly air temperature and precipitation data. 


General aims:
1) What are the main environmental and climate variables explaining the variance of the biomarker dataset? 
2) Can we build a function/model with the biomarkers that predicts salinity?



Dataset details: 

Columns C to Q = these are the proxy or biomarkers, i.e. the bacterial lipid. They are shown as %. The "." in the headers of columns D, F, H, J,L,N is a substitute for the
real nomenclature of the lipids which should be for example IIIa', IIIb' etc. It's to make it R friendly.

Columns R and S = Latitude and Longitude

Column T = Sample depth in meters (m). It's the depth of the lake at that sampling point

Column u = Lake area in Km2

Column V = Altitude in meters (m)

Columns W to AM = monthly, annual and seasonal precipitation in millimeters (mm)

Columns AN to BD = average monthly, annual and seasonal air temperature in oC

Column BE = Soil pH. This is the average pH of the catchment soils of each lake

Column BF = Water Temperature in oC

Column BG = Surface (i.e. upper 1 meter) Water Temperature in oC. 

Column GG = Water salinity in parts per million (ppm)

Column BI = Average Organic Carbon of water column

Column BJ = Total Organic Carbon of Water 

Column BK = Oxygen of water (%)

Column BL = average Water pH

Column BM = total dissolved solids

Columns BN to BV = cation anion data of the water column
